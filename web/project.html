    	<p class="paragraph">An assignment/project and a self-assessment will be due each week at 11:59 PM on Saturday night Mountain Time. For much of the first half of the semester, students will work on an individual project, where the weekly assignments make up pieces of the overall project. For the second half of the semester, students will be divided into teams working on more in depth projects and will have weekly milestones to meet.</p>
